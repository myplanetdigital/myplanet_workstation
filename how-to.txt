- Download Mountain Lion from App Store
- Copy the boot disk file to the desktop

    cp /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Mountain\ Lion.app/Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg ~/Desktop

- Open Disk Util and "Restore" USB image with that DMG file. You've got your boot disk
- Restart OSX and hold option key with the USB key inserted, Choose ______
- Start disk util
- Open "Partition" tab on main drive, and click "+" to add a new partition.
- Drag the slider until its just a little larger than the current required space
- Name the new partition and apply
- Choose "Reinstall OSX"
- Choose the new partition and continue along. Start fresh and don't import old user data.
- After restarting, your old data will be available on "Macintosh HD". I suggest keeping that around for a few weeks, and then, once you've started from scratch and made sure everything is in the cloud or version-controlled, delete it and reinstall OSX fresh, using a single partition on the laptop
